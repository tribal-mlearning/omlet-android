# Open Mobile Learning Environment (OMLET)

This repository contains the source code for the OMLET exemplar Android application.

## Building

The source code has been written and exported from the Eclipse IDE. The quickest way to
start working with the source code is to import the *omlet-app* folder into Eclipse as an 
Android application and *tribal-mobile* folder as an Android library, and add the required 
dependencies for each project into the particular libs folder.
